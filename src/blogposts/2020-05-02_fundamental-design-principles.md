### Space

<br />

#### 1. Proximity relationships

Elements which are closer to each other than to other elements are perceived as being more related. <br/>
For example: There should be more space between different paragraphs than between the lines inside a paragraph.
<br /><br />

#### 2. Negative Space

Try to use as much negative space as you can in your designs.<br/>
Negative space clears out your design and makes it more intuitive.<br/>
Putting too many elements into limited space is like trying to listen to several people at once, it will be really hard to follow.

<br /><br />

#### 3. Order

Things that are more important either have to use more space in your design or be positioned on top of the less important elements.
<br /><br />

### Consistency

<br />
Similar elements should be displayed in similar ways.<br />
This way you make sure that people are not distracted by things changing all the time, it is way easier for them to focus on the important parts of your design.<br />
What is more, the usage of consistency is crucial when it comes to making things look actually designed.<br />
Things to stick to once set:

- Font
- Transitions on hover, on focus etc.
- style of common elements like buttons, links, etc.
- positions (for example if a save button on a subpage is on the bottom, do not put it on top in another subpage)
  <br /><br />

### Visual Noise

<br />
Be economical with the number of elements you use in your design. The fewer the better.<br />
The human brain tends to get an cognitive overload when it needs to process too much information at once.<br />
If something can be achieved with 2 elements do not use 3.<br />
Design minimalistic!
<br /><br />

### Contrast

<br />
Make sure there is enough contrast between all elements.<br />
Elements of your design should be either exactly the same, or significantly different.<br />
Common design aspects where to consider checking contrast:
<br /><br />

#### 1. Color

Use dark on light colors and vice versa.
<br /><br />

#### 2. Style

For example: Do not use different italic font styles next to each other unless they are considerably different.
<br /><br />

#### 3. Size

For example: Be sure that adjacent elements have either the same size or considerably different ones.
<br /><br />

#### 4. Weight

Adjacent elements should have either exactly the same weight or are considerably different.
<br /><br />

### Color

<br />

#### 1. Color Set

Do not use more than 2-3 different colors in your palette - different shades are ok.
<br /><br />

#### 2. Saturation

Do not use too much saturation. Start with less than you think, then adjust to taste.
<br /><br />

#### 3. Contrast

Be sure that the colors in your set have enough contrast.<br />
To make sure the colors contrasts are fine turn your view to black and white and have a look at them there.
