User Experience Design is a very new term in the job market. The job market is flooded with companies looking to hire UX Designers. Many people are assuming to be one. 

**But what exactly is the profession of a UX designer and what is the difference to a 'normal' designer?**

There is a lot of talk with very little clarity on this - let's try to break it down a little bit.

## Elaboration
<br/>

As a first step let's start with the term design itself. Wikipedia gives the following definition for 'designer': 
**A designer is a person who plans the look or workings of something prior to it being made, by preparing drawings or plans**<br /><br />

Let's take this definition apart piece by piece to get more clarity from it.
<br /><br />

### [...] is a person [...]
This is mostly true for now, in the future there is a chance that AI will replace designers in many ways. So a designer is not necessarily a person.
<br /><br />

### [...] who plans [...]
Planning itself is a process which needs a goal. Without a goal it is simply not possible to plan something.
<br /><br />

### [...] the look or workings of something [...]
Nowadays is it very common that the goal of a design is **user-centered**, so something like: 'Potential buyers need to find their desired product asap to avoid frustration'. This is where User Experience comes into play. Every time a design has a human user as target group, it is showtime for UX designers. BUT the main goal of a design could also be - let's say - reshaping a sensor for it to fit into a new smartphone concept. This goal is **not user-centered** as there is no user included in this process in its purity.
<br /><br />

### [...] prior to it being made [...]
This is the timespot where design makes sense, any other time in the development process design is not effective and should be avoided. This is common sense I think.
<br /><br />

### [...] by preparing drawings or plans [...]
This is about the outcome of a designers work. Drawings can be wireframes, prototypes, technical drawings asf. In my opinion plans should always be included into any kind of design, a drawing is often not clear enough. So I would change this definition to 'by preparing drawings AND plans'. The outcome of a designers work should not leave any questions open for the development itself.
<br /><br />

## Summary
<br />

When speaking of design, people are often thinking about user-centered visual design. But even visuals need to be functional in some way. So any time you are looking for a designer nowadays, you are looking for a user experience designer. The trend term UX design therefore is just design according to today's standards.
