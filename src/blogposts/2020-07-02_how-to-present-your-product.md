As I've seen many approaches of people trying to pitch their products to potential partners or customers or just to present themselves or their products online I thought it is a great idea to nail down some tips on what to think of when it comes to presenting yourself and your products.

### Patterns
<br/>

When presenting keep in mind that even if there is no finelined pattern on your website, flyer or whatever medium you are using to present your product, the audience's brain will try to find one, visually and contentwise.<br /><br />

Brains can handle information only in blocks. Too much information coming in at once will be flushed out of the brain with ease. **The magic number here is 4**. That's why IBAN numbers, PIN Codes etc. are often shown in blocks of 4, to make them easier to be remembered.<br /><br />

### Stories
<br />

To tweak your presentation try to either fit some stories into your presentation or your presentation into a story. Stories can get people to identify with your product more by activating their mirror neurons.<br /><br />

#### Mirror Neurons

I will put mirror neurons down very specific and easy for our purposes here. Because of mirror neurons we become sad if something sad happens on a tv show etc. - so basically **emotions are getting mirrored**. This works for actions too, for instance if somebody asks you how you are he expects you to ask back, if you don't he will be confused or rather having a negative emotion.<br /><br />

Taking this information to - let's say our webshop - it is very important for it to function properly. If a potential buyer clicks somewhere and thus expects a reaction but nothing happens, he will be confused.<br /><br />

This can lead the potential buyer to become a lost opportunity for you, maybe one of many. **So be sure there are no deficiencies in your presentation** - that means no technical leaks on your website, no typos in your menu, etc.<br /><br />

### Choices
<br />

People like having a choice. Choices are giving us the feeling of being in control and nothing let's us be more positive then the feeling of being in control. Be sure give choices as often as possible, but **not too many** as it quickly gets overchallenging. The magic number 4 from above is a good amount here too.<br />

### flow state
<br />

We are in the flow state when an activity engages us so much that we lose track of time. Our immersion and focus level is so high that it seems like there is nothing else of relevance for us.<br /><br />

Nowadays we get into this state very often when using our smartphones, mainly because of the push messages we get. The constancy of the information flow connected to the excitement we feel when getting these gets us to spend way too many hours looking onto these screens.<br /><br />

If you want to raise your audiences engagement level **give them constant feedback to trigger a flow state**. Online you can achieve this for instance by adding a chatbot which sends messages to the user frequently. BUT! everything should happen without disturbing them while browsing your website. So do not use too many pop ups which are blocking their view or similar.<br /><br />

As you see it is mainly about invoking positive emotions when it comes to your presentation. Make sure to think through every step of it, build in one or more stories, give your audience choices and raise their engagement level by triggering a flow state.
