We all know the situation when we want to change something in our lives. It can be everything from learning an instrument, writing a book or even quitting our job or divorcing our partner. Very often we tell ourselves 'This is too hard' before we even make a step into realising. Instead of trying we throw in the sponge with ease.

**We forget that everything is hard before it gets easy.**

### To learn = to lose at first
<br/>

As a child you learned many different things. You learned to walk, to speak, to write and even to do math. These things were hard at first too, why is it that you did not give up back then?<br /><br />

As we get older it seems that we become more and more resitant to **the learning process**, which requires willpower, motivation, desire and the **joy of losing**. We are always looking for things that do not require a lot of work or any radical change in our routine. It is very hard for most of us to change something even if it's essential for us to be happy.<br /><br />

Enjoying to lose is a very rare skill nowadays. Without the joy of losing it's not possible to learn something new or to surpass oneself. So do not get tired to lose and do not be afraid of it. Take yourself as a child as your role model when it comes to try something new. When we were trying to walk we stood up and fell many times before it finally worked. The first time we rode a bike we risked falling and hurting ourselves but still most of us are able to ride a bike today.<br /><br />

We forget that it's normal for a new thing to be hard before it gets easy.<br /><br />

**Fall down seven times, stand up eight.**

<br />

**If you can change something that makes you unhappy to something that makes you happy, do it!**
