This quote by business consultant <a href="https://simonsinek.com/">Simon Sinek</a> might sound a bit weird at first, as it does not make sense perfectly from a structural perspective.<br />
Let me explain a bit more as diving deeper into this will pay off in many ways for people who are building their own business or planning to do so.

## The Golden Circle

The Golden Circle is the visual of Sinek's 'Why, How, What'-model. Here is a short wrap up of how Sinek describes these three questions from an organization's point of view:<br /><br />

### What?

Every organization knows what they do. They know what products or services they are offering, basically for what they get profit for. The 'what' is what many companies live and die by.<br /><br />

### How?

Only a few companies know their 'how'. They may know their USP (unique selling proposition) by doing research and finding the best way to bring their products/services to their customers.<br /><br />

### Why?

Very few organizations know their 'why'. By 'why' Sinek does not mean 'to make profit', this is something Sinek defines as a result. A real 'why' would be the purpose, cause or belief of the organization.<br /><br />

The way humans tend to think is from the clearest thing to the most indistinct thing. So when we want to found a company, we normally start thinking about the 'what' as it is the most tangible thing to think about, then about the 'how'. After communicating the 'what' and 'how' we expect people to react accordingly. Often the marketing of regular companies work the same way, they are trying to convince potential buyers by listing the hard facts of the product's or service's benefits:<br /><br />

**WHAT -> HOW:**
'We make great computers. They are beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly. Wanna buy one?'<br /><br />
The approach of inspired organizations and leaders is to think, act and communicate from the inside out. Apple for instance communicates like this:<br /><br />
**WHY -> HOW -> WHAT:**
'Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo, we believe in thinking differently. The way we are challenging the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly. We just happened to make great computers. Wanna buy one?'<br /><br />
The latter works way better as potential buyers get the intention they are supporting something great. By handing them the why, the fuzziest and most complex question is answered, we are impressed, relieved and want to support the belief of the company.<br />
**So find your 'why' and start from there!**
