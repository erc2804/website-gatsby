Luckily most companies in the tech industry nowadays know <strong>that it's crucial for their success to not only collect information on their (potential) users' needs but to deeply understand them</strong>.
<br />
On a macro there are just three ways to do this - some work better than others.
<br />
In this short article I'll dig a bit deeper into these three approaches.

### Approach 1: Knowing better without actually knowing better
<br />
I'm sure that some of you guys out there have had experiences working with somebody who thinks he knows very well what the product should look like to be the perfect solution for the users without actually having any kind of evidence. 
<br />
As design requires insight, not assumptions, this approach is the one with the most negative impact on your product. 
<br /><br />
Fortunately there are fewer and fewer people with that attitude, because more and more data-based and well-designed products are released, which are proven to be used more frequently and the companies behind them are thus more successful. 
<br /><br />
If you in fact ARE one of those guys then I would strongly recommend to try the next two approaches to be on the safe side!
<br /><br />

### Approach 2: Collecting data from actual users to get general ideas
<br />
It's no secret that websites and apps are tracking our behaviour and interaction. Nevertheless there is a transparent and an intransparent way of doing so. 
<br /><br />
Tracking simple data giving users the option to deactivate this via a (well-designed and easy-to-understand!) cookie prompt is a good example on how relevant data can be collected without being shady. 
<br />
Another option would be to directly ask users while they actually use the product or even better: after they finished doing something on your website or app. For example asking users who bought something of your webshop how much they liked the buying process from 1 to 10 or if they found everything they needed. Giving a user options to give feedback without disturbing him is the key here. 
<br /><br />

### Approach 3: Talking to actual users to get qualitative insights
<br />
The richest way is to actually ask your users or your target group what they want. 
<br /><br />
One important factor here is the number of people you ask. I've made the experience that there are companies that only ask a few people who are near their target group, sometimes even from within their company, and fully rely on those statements. This is definitely better than nothing but also not good enough. It is kind of like asking somebody who have been to a supermarket before what his feelings on the grocery shopping experience were and then to conclude from this to all others. Doesn't make sense, does it?
<br /><br />

Another important aspect is HOW you ask. Users perfectly know what they want, but often are not able to articulate it precisely. So you shouldn’t take all of your users’ feedback literally. There is a fitting quote for this from Henry Ford, founder of the Ford Motor Company, that says:

**“If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.”**

The only way to handle this is by asking specific and segregated questions. If you ask the right questions, you’ll get rich information that will help you get valuable insights on how to develop your product further.
